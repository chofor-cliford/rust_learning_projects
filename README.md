## About 📖

This repository is a collection of projects and exercises that I am working on to learn and master Rust. Each new concept is developed or continued by creating a new branch, allowing for organized and modular learning.

## Projects 🚀

Here are some of the concepts and projects I've covered:

- **Project 1:** Basic Syntax and Hello World
- **Project 2:** Variables and Data Types
- **Project 3:** Control Flow
- **Project 4:** Ownership and Borrowing
- **Project 5:** Structs and Enums
- **Project 6:** Collections
- **Project 7:** Error Handling
- **Project 8:** Modules and Crates

## Branches 🌿

Each branch in this repository represents a different concept or project. Here are the branches and what they cover:

- `main`: Overview and setup of the repository.
- `basic-syntax`: Basic syntax and Hello World.
- `variables-data-types`: Variables and data types.
- `control-flow`: Control flow constructs.
- `ownership-borrowing`: Ownership and borrowing.
- `structs-enums`: Structs and enums.
- `collections`: Working with collections.
- `error-handling`: Error handling techniques.
- `modules-crates`: Modules and crates in Rust.

## Installation 💻

To get started with any of the projects, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-learning-projects.git
cd rust-learning-projects
```

Then, check out the branch you are interested in:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

## Usage 🛠️

Each branch contains its own README with specific instructions on how to run the project or exercise. Typically, you can build and run a Rust project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
